# Python Tasks Repository

This repository contains a collection of short Python tasks and challenges. Each task explores fundamental programming concepts, helping build problem-solving skills with Python. Below is a brief description of the tasks:

### Task List:

1. **Decoding_Aliens.ipynb**  
   A simple task that leverages looping constructs and basic data types to solve an alien language decoding problem.

2. **Functions.ipynb**  
   This notebook contains several tasks focused on writing and using functions in Python. The tasks demonstrate key concepts of reusability and modular coding.

3. **Intersection_of_Lists.ipynb**  
   A task that involves finding the intersection of two lists without using any in-built Python methods, focusing on algorithmic problem-solving.

Each task is implemented with clarity, aiming to provide hands-on experience with basic programming principles.
